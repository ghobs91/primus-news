# Primus News - Actionable news, directly from the source

Primus News aims to focus on news with two qualities:

1. Actionable: news that you can actually act on in your daily life, things that have an answer to the question "what can I do with this information?"
2. Direct from the source: when news comes directly from the primary source, you get the most accurate picture of the information, rather than getting a version that's been manipulated to fit a news agency's financial/ideological goals.
